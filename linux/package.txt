Package Management

========================================
aptget

$ man apt-get

apt-get is the command-line tool for handling packages, and may be considered the user's "back-end" to other tools using the APT library. Several "front-end" interfaces exist, such as dselect(8), aptitude(8), synaptic(8), gnome-apt(1) and wajig(1).

aptitude

$ man aptitude

aptitude is a text-based interface to the Debian GNU/Linux package system.
It allows the user to view the list of packages and to perform package management tasks such as installing, upgrading, and removing packages.
Actions may be performed from a visual interface or from the command-line.

aptitude vs. apt-get:

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/debian-26/apt-get-vs.-aptitude-363365/

All three packages do the same bottom line, just in different ways with different options. I don't think one is better than the other, it is all personal preference. I have used apt from the beginning, and I love it. It is the most archaic, and doesn't automatically load dependencies like aptitude or synaptic, but it does list the dependencies which you can manually install if you wish. I have grown quite fond of apt, and studied the apt how-to constantly for the first month I was
running Debian.

No matter which package manager you wish to use, just keep one thing in mind, do not switch back and forth. The three P.M.'s do not keep track of each other; so if you use apt for the first 6 months, and then try aptitude, it will try uninstalling all of the packages you have installed over the previous 6 months. Many a poor soul has made the mistake thinking that aptitude knew what it was doing.

Like I said, apt doesn't have all of the features that the other two have, but you do have the same capabilities. Apt will remove most dependencies if you remove with --purge. To keep dependencies clean, you have debfoster, deborphan, and autoclean. And to keep buggy packages from getting installed, you have apt-listbugs, and like Xian said, a system log is kept at /var/log/dpkg. The bottom line is to find one that works for you and have fun with it.

One nice feature in aptitude: it keeps a log of its actions in /var/log/aptitude . Apt-get doesn't keep any log.

A log of system package changes is kept in /var/log/dpkg. It is not provided by apt, but when apt installs, configures, removes, etc. any package it is recorded in that log in Debian.

这个 KDE 自带的包管理器，实在没什么可取之处。
